    <h2>LD 101</h2>
    <h3> Deontology Good </h3>
     <p> 1. It is the obligation of individuals to take or refrain from taking certain actions based on their moral value. Such moral values are widely known and accepted, thus more effectively determining an individual’s course of action, rather than calculating the more rewarding outcome.
      <br>2. Deontological morality allows consideration to family, friends, and other preferences (ex: saving  one’s child even at the expense of others).
      <br>3. Allows supererogatory (“beyond the call of duty”)
      <br>4. The future is uncertain and impossible to predict. Therefore we can only take moral actions to ensure the best possible outcome.
      <br>5. Rationality distinguishes humans from other animals, thus we should have respect for our own rationality.
      <br>6. Morality is driven from a notion of freedom, and stems from the fact that we are allowed to choose actions
      <br>7. If people are allowed to be used as a means to an end, humanity would lose value because they would become agents for a greater good (letting five people die and one person survive would increase the value of the survivor) </p>
    <h3> Utilitarianism Good </h3>
     <p> 1. Policy makers do not know the impact to each and every person, and should therefore weigh the costs and benefits.
      <br> 2. Weighing the costs and benefits of utilitarianism is easier than judging the intrinsic values and impact of a situation for every person. Furthermore, the line between what is morally right and what is morally wrong is arbitrary (ex: killing one to save five is wrong, but killing one to save millions may be morally justified)
      <br> 3. Utilitarianism requires impartiality among all people. If everyone is worth the same, then we ought to maximize the benefits for the greatest number of people.
      <br> 4. People intuitively make decisions in daily life based on foreseen consequences 
      <br> 5. General happiness is maximized by calculating the greatest good for the greatest number of people, in which pleasures are qualitative. (John Stuart Mill) </p>
    <h3> Social Contract Good </h3>
     <p> 1. Social contract acts as an equilibrium that secures rights (ex: life, protection, property) for the people and the authority of the government.
      <br> 2. Creates a social order that ends the state of nature and allows people to cooperate by governing how people are to treat each other.
      <br> 3. Justifies why laws should be followed (mutual benefits and fear of punishment)
      <br> 4. Describes a plausible account of when civil disobedience is justified. </p>
