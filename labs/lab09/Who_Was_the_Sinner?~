Who Was the Sinner?

Once upon a time there were ten weirdnoun, who were randverbing a randomnoun together. They were randverbed by a randadj thunder-storm, and took refuge in a randadj mainnoun. But the thunder drew ever nearer, and so great was the tumult that the mainnoun trembled about them, while the randomnoun flew around the mainnoun in a continuous circle. The weirdnoun were greatly randverbed, and thought that there must be a sinner among them, whom the randomnoun would strike. In order to find out who it might be, they agreed to hang their randadj randomnoun up before the SubChar, and he whose SubChar was blown away was to yield himself up to his fate.

No sooner were the SubChars outside, than one of them was randverb away, and the rest thrust its unfortunate owner out of randomnoun without randverb. But as soon as he had left the mainnoun the randomnoun ceased circling around, and struck the mainnoun with a crash.

The one whom the rest had thrust out, had been the only righteous one among them, and for his sake the randomnoun had spared the mainnoun. So the other nine had to pay for their hard-heartedness with their randomnoun.
