<p>Once upon a time there was a SubChar who dug up a randadj, randadj mainnoun in his randomnoun. So SubChar took it home with him and told his randomnoun to randverb the mainnoun out. But when his randomnoun started randverb the inside of the mainnoun, the mainnoun suddenly began to fill itself with mainnoun. No matter how many were taken out, others kept on taking their place. So the SubChar randverb the mainnoun, and the family managed to live quite randadv. </p>

<p>Once a randomnoun fell into the mainnoun by mistake. At once the mainnoun disappeared and the mainnoun began to fill itself with randomnoun. So now the family became rich; for they could take as much randomnoun out of the mainnoun as ever they wished.</p>

<p>Now the SubChar had an old randomnoun at home, who was randadj and randadj. Since there was nothing else he could do, SubChar set him to work randverbing randomnoun out of the mainnoun, and when the randadj randomnoun grew randverb and could not keep on, SubChar would fall into a rage, and randverb at him randadv, randverbing him he was randadj and did not want to work. One day, however, the old manâ€™s strength gave out, and he fell into the mainnoun and died. At once the randomnoun disappeared, and the whole mainnoun began to fill itself with randomnoun. Then the SubChar had to pull them all out and have them buried, and for this purpose he had to use up again all the randomnoun he had received. And when he was through, the mainnoun broke, and he was just as poor as before. </p>
