<p>     Once upon a time there lived SubChar who wanted to randverb a weirdnoun; but she would have to be a real weirdnoun. SubChar randverb all over the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what he wanted. There were weirdnouns enough, but it was randadj to find out whether they were real ones. There was always something about them that was not as it should be. So SubChar came home again and was randadj, for he would have liked very much to have a real weirdnoun.</p>

<p>     One evening a randadj storm came on; there was randomnoun and randomnoun, and the randomnoun poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old randomnoun went to open it.</p>

<p>     It was a weirdnoun standing out there in front of the randomnoun. But, good gracious! what a sight the randomnoun and the randomnoun had made her look. The randomnoun ran down from her randomnoun and randomnoun; it ran down into the toes of her randomnoun and out again at the randomnoun. And yet she said that she was a real weirdnoun.</p>

<p>     Well, we'll soon find that out, thought the old randomnoun. But she said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the randomnoun off the randomnoun, and laid a mainnoun on the bottom; then she took twenty randomnoun and laid them on the mainnoun, and then twenty eider-down randomnoun on top of the randomnoun.</p>

<p>     On this the weirdnoun had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept.</p>

<p>     "Oh, very badly!" said she. "I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the randomnoun, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am randcolor and randcolor all over my body. It's randadj!"</p>

<p>     Now they knew that she was a real weirdnoun because she had felt the mainnoun right through the twenty randomnoun and the twenty eider-down randomnoun.</p>

<p>     Nobody but a real weirdnoun could be as randadj as that.</p>

<p>     So SubChar took her for his randomnoun, for now SubChar knew that he had a real weirdnoun; and the mainnoun was put in the randomnoun, where it may still be seen, if no one has randverb it.</p>

<p>     There, that is a true story.</p>
