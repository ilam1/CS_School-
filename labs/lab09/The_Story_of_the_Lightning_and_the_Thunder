<p>	In the olden days the SubChar and mainnoun lived on the randomnoun amongst all the other Char2, but the Char2s made them live at the far end of the randomnoun, as far as possible from other Char2's randomnoun.</p>

<p>	The SubChar was an randadj mother sheep, and the mainnoun was her son, a weirdnoun. Whenever the weirdnoun got randverb he used to go about and randverb randomnoun and randverb randomnoun; he even randverb on the randomnoun, and sometimes randverb randomnoun. Whenever the mainnoun did these things, his mother used to call out to him in a very randadj voice to stop and not to do any more damage; but the mainnoun did not care in the least for what his mother said, and when he was in a randadj temper used to do a very large amount of damage. At last the Char2 could not stand it any longer, and complained to the randomnoun.</p>

<p>	So the randomnoun made a randadj order that the sheep (SubChar) and her son, the weirdnoun (mainnoun), should leave the randomnoun and live in the randadj randomnoun. This did not do much good, as when the weirdnoun got randverb he still randverb the randomnoun, and the randomnoun sometimes spread to the randomnoun and consumed them.</p>

<p>	So the Char2 complained again, and the randomnoun randverbed both the mainnoun and the SubChar from the randomnoun and made them randverb in the randomnoun, where they could not cause so much destruction. Ever since, when the mainnoun is angry, he commits damage as before, but you can hear his mother, the SubChar, rebuking him and randverbing him to randverb. Sometimes, however, when the mother has gone away some distance from her randadj son, you can still see that he is randverb and is randverbing, but his mother's voice cannot be heard.</p>
